Nim is a turn-based mathematical strategy game played by two players. Players take turns taking one or more pieces from a pile of chess pieces (there are several piles in total, and you can only take them from one pile at a time) (or any props). The player who can no longer take any more is the loser. A pile of such pieces is called a nim pile when the corresponding number is specified.
R.P. Sprague and P.M. Grundy independently proved that all unbiased games (starting from any situation, both sides can take exactly the same actions, that is, there is no color distinction on the chessboard) are Equivalent to a nim heap of a specific size. But the number of chess pieces contained in the nim pile here can be infinite. In fact, it can be any ordinal number. Nim Game is a famous game with many variations. Two players take turns taking a portion of the items from the pile. At each step, players are free to choose how many items to take, but must take at least one and at most half of the items before it is the next player's turn. The player who takes the last item loses the game.
In smart mode, the computer removes enough items each time so that the size of the pile is a power of 2 minus 1—that is, 3, 7, 15, 31, or 63. Except that the size of the heap is already a power of 2 minus 1, this approach is in line with the rules of the game in other cases. In that case, the computer randomly takes away some according to the rules of the game.
尼姆游戏是一种两个人玩的回合制数学战略游戏。游戏者轮流从一堆棋子（一共有好几堆，一次只能从其中一堆拿。）（或者任何道具）中取走一个或者多个，最后不能再取的就是输家。当指定相应数量时，一堆这样的棋子称作一个尼姆堆。
斯普莱格（R.P.Sprague）和格隆第（P.M.Grundy）独立地证明了一切无偏博弈（从任何一个局势出发，双方可以采取完全相同的行动，也就是说棋盘上没有颜色的区分）都等价于一个特定大小的尼姆堆。但这里的尼姆堆包含的棋子数量可以是无穷的。事实上，它可以是任何序数。 尼姆游戏是个著名的游戏，有很多变种玩法。两个玩家轮流从一堆物品中拿走一部分。在每一步中，玩家可以自由选择拿走多少物品，但是必须至少拿走一个并且最多只能拿走一半物品，然后轮到下一个玩家。拿走最后一个物品的玩家输掉游戏。
在聪明模式中，计算机每次拿走足够多的物品使得堆的大小是2的幂次方减1——也就是3,7,15,31或63。除了堆的大小已经是2的幂次方减1，在其他情况下这样走都是符合游戏规则的。在那种情况下，计算机就按游戏规则随机拿走一些。
